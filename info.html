      <p class="w3-large">Rocket technologys getting more and more advanced every day. We used to not be able to recover the entire rockets and we would only get broken pieces of the rocket to salvage. Now we are making new ways to reuse rockets. We are also making new ways to make more fuel effcient rockets. There are a lot of technology that goes into space rockets to make them get into space, and be able to come back. Rockets use massive engines to take ther weight and componints to space. With bigger engines, you need more fuel and with more fuel there is more weight. The people that build the rockets have to find the most effiecnt way to use the fuel with out putting too much weight. The workers have to piece each part of the rocket together from trucks and if they miss one part of the ship, the entire thing can fail. Scientists design these rockets with high areodinamicts and propulution to get to space. If the ship dosen't have areodynamics and its bulky, It wont cut through the air good and will be hard to control. It it doesn't have enough propulsion, then the ship won"t have enough power to go to space. Most space companies use computers with 3D designing programs to model and calculate parts of the ship. Companies from all over the country build these parts and NASA and other space companies buy these big parts and engines. </p>
